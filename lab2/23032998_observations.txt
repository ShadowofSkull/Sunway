1. Observe effect of two class in one element:
2. I put class="class1 class2" in the element, class1 set font size to 100px and bold while class2 set font size to 300px
3. When two classes is added to one element the element obtain both classes' properties, however the last defined class which is class2 will override class1's font size
4. So long the element has the class it will get the style changes of it, and if there's conflicting properties the last defined class will override previous classes properties
5. It is a great method to create different styles in a class and applying them when needed.

1. Same id in two different elements
2. For two different li element i apply the same id for both of them. 
3. The two element inherit the properties of css for the specific id
4. When the website compile the css it apply to the element separately so long it match the id
5. Although it is better to have one element with the id, css styles will still apply even if you repeat the id in different element

1. Create two classes with same name
2. The same element has the two same name apply to it
3. The class that is defined later in the css will override conflicting properties in the class defined before it. However, non-confliciting properties will be inherited from both
4. CSS disregard the name of the class and priotise the sequence the class is defined.  
5. It is possible to define two or more classes with the same name
