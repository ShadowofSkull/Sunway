# Sunway Agility Challenge (42KL)
During the challenge at the 42KL division we were asked to create a discord bot that can potentially solve some of the problems faced by Sunway's business unit or some other ideas we wanted to do. In the end, my team decided to make a fintech bot that web scrap from yahoo finance and do some operations with the info.

## Functions
- Get income statement
- Get balance sheet
- Get cashflow statement
- Get stock volatility
- Get percentage change in revenue (%)
- Compare stock pe ratio with benchmark

### Reflection
This is my first project where it has some real world application as one of my teammate still uses it after the challenge is over for his school projects so I am proud of it. I am also exposed to API, csv, web scraping during the workshop they provided and those are knowledge I can carry forward in tech so I am glad I try the challenge. Overall, thanks you to my teammates who are experts in finance and work with me to build my first fintech project.

Note: Some improvement could have done such as making a function that will do half of the thing instead of repeating it at every different function. I thought of this when I was coding this but due to the time limitation I just copy pasted the code and modify them manually.
